# gameoflife FOX
black cubs are foxes
yellow cubs are rabbits
green cubs are carrots
foxes can eat rabbits 
rabbits can eat carrots
carrot eats nothing
they only can move to their foods place (eat means replace food place)
if there two of fox or rabbit there can born new one.(1+1 =  3)
if there many foxes in one place(if there one fox and his fox neighbors more than 4) the fox dies
there no overpopulation with rabbits
carrots appear randomly 
if there is another rabbit and a carrot next to the rabbit, then he will choose the carrot instead of the rabbit. Same with the fox. (Food, not baby)
